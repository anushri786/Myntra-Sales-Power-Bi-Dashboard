# Myntra-Sales-Power-Bi-Dashboard

Myntra sales analysis in Power BI using category, sub-category, market, and state helps to understand the performance of sales across various dimensions. Here are five key points to consider:

Category and Sub-Category Analysis: By analyzing sales data by category and sub-category, Myntra can identify which product categories and sub-categories are performing well and which are underperforming. This helps to make informed decisions on inventory, marketing, and promotions to maximize sales.

Market Analysis: Sales data analysis by market allows Myntra to understand the performance of sales in different regions. This can help to identify areas of growth potential, adjust marketing strategies, and optimize inventory to meet demand.

State Analysis: Sales data analysis by state helps Myntra understand which states are contributing to the majority of their sales and which states need improvement. It can also identify regional trends, preferences, and purchase behaviors that can help inform marketing strategies and product selection.

Sales Trend Analysis: Power BI can also be used to create trend analyses to identify sales trends over time. This information can be used to develop long-term strategies that align with consumer demand.

Dashboard Creation: Power BI allows for the creation of interactive dashboards that can be easily shared across teams and departments. This helps to keep everyone on the same page with key metrics and KPIs to drive sales growth.
